										<p>Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning.</p>

										<summary>How often change filter?</summary>
										<p>We recommend every 90 days for peak efficiency.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>What regular maintenance does a heating and air conditioning system need?</summary>
										<p>The most important aspect of Heating and Air Conditioning system maintenance is ensuring that the system maintains unrestricted air flow. Dust, dirt, and debris are the Heating and Air Conditioning system’s worst enemies. Whether it’s an indoor or outdoor unit, it is important to keep all filters clean as well as heat exchangers and coils free of restrictions that is caused by these elements.

											We recommend that your heating and air conditioning system be checked and serviced twice a year; ideally a spring and autumn tune-up. Also we recommend that you change your filter regularly, depending on the type of filter you have. This alone can eliminate many of the most common problems and can significantly reduce the likelihood of a serious and possible costly heating and air conditioning repair. A Complete Club Membership is your assurance that these maintenance needs are met regularly and that any potential problems are promptly identified.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>Why do I need to change my filter regularly?</summary>
										<p>Regular filter replacement helps your heating and air conditioning system operate at peak levels and improves indoor air quality. It is important to change filters regularly to ensure proper air flow and to keep your home free from dust, allergens and germs. Depending on the type of filter you have, you may require weekly or monthly filter replacements. Your Complete Cool Air service professional will recommend the ideal filters and replacement schedule recommended for your heating and air conditioning unit(s).</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>In addition to changing my filters, what maintenance should I do on my heater and/or air conditioner?</summary>
										<p>Most maintenance should be performed only by a qualified service technician. But here are some things that you can do to assure optimal performance:

											Keep ground mounted outdoor units clear of debris, clutter and weeds; they can reduce the airflow to the unit.
											Use caution with weed trimmers around the unit to prevent damaging control wiring.
											Keep pets away from the unit; pet urine can cause expensive damage.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>How often should I have maintenance done on my air conditioner and heating system?</summary>
										<p>You should have maintenance done on your heating and air conditioning system at least twice a year – spring to early summer for air conditioning system check and fall to early winter for the heating system being the best times. This not only ensures maximum efficiency and energy cost savings, it enables us to foresee any possible problems that may occur in the near future.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>Is there anything I should check prior to calling for service?</summary>
										<p>Check to be sure that your air conditioner or heating system is turned on. Check that the breakers and any safety disconnects are on and be sure the thermostat is set correctly. It is helpful to make note of any strange noises or smells to discuss with your Complete Cool Air service professional.​​​</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>How do I know if my air conditioner or heating system is working properly?</summary>
										<p>Is it making strange noises? Is it cooling or heating all areas of your home sufficiently? Has it been taking longer to cool down or heat up your home with no significant change in environmental temperature? Have your utility bills been rising for no apparent reason? Any of these are signs that you may have a problem that needs service. In most cases, the longer you delay, the worse any underlying problems will get. So be sure to contact Complete Cool Air to check out your system whenever you notice anything out of the ordinary.​</p>

										<summary>How important is it to get the right size of heating and air conditioning system?</summary>
										<p>Sizing your air conditioner and heating systems is very important from the standpoint of both comfort and energy use or cost. A heating and air conditioning system which is over-capacity will start and stop more frequently or not run long enough to remove humidity in your home. In both cases, this may mean poor humidity control. It could also result in temperature variations or noticeable cycling. Another important fact to know is that an over-capacity equipment will not be as energy efficient as properly matched capacity system. On the other hand, equipment that is under-sized, will obviously result in loss of comfort during temperature extremes.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>What size Heating and Air Conditioning system should I have?</summary>
										<p>Unfortunately, there’s no simple rule of thumb for determining the ideal size of system for each home. For example, depending upon the construction of your home, one (1) ton of air conditioning can cool anywhere from 300 to 800 square feet of home. The only way to insure the size of the system you purchase will be large enough to heat or cool your home, but not any larger than you need, is to have your home’s individual heating and cooling needs evaluated by a licensed professional. Complete Cool Air will perform a FREE detailed In-Home Energy Analysis to determine a selection of systems that will work best for your home’s needs and your budget.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>Is a heating and air conditioning system with more capacity better?</summary>
										<p>No. A larger heating system with more capacity delivers less comfort and costs more to operate. An air conditioner is at its least optimal efficiency when it is first turned on. A system with too much capacity will run in numerous short cycles, turning on and off repeatedly, therefore causing it to be less efficient. Also keep in mind that an air conditioner only removes humidity when it’s running, so a system with shorter run cycles doesn’t remove humidity from the air very well.</p>
									</details>
									<details>
										<summary>How do I know if my Air Conditioner is big enough?</summary>
										<p>Bigger isn’t always better; its performance and efficiency that count. Before purchasing a replacement system you should always make sure your system is sized properly to match your needs and budget. Your Complete Cool Air Specialist will thoroughly assess your home and comfort requirements to determine the proper size and make the appropriate recommendation.</p>
